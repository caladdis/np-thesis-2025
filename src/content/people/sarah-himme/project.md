“Love Where you Live - A Community Mural Proposal” is an effort to create a mural in my hometown of Cobleskill, New York. This proposal aims to better connect the general public to the arts community through engaging interested locals in the ideation process. Through creative brainstorming sessions at the local library with community members, many ideas were discussed, yet there were some common themes: seasons and barn quilt motifs. The project also includes a zine that shares lessons learned for proposing and designing a community-based mural.
